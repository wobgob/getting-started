# Getting Started

## Introduction
If you're a developer you can create your own server. If you're a player you can help test other people's servers.

## Creating an account
```
/account create <username> <password> <password>
```

You can create a Wobblin' Goblin account in the [Wobblin' Goblin Discord](https://discord.gg/rqq33HmMyX). Direct message Winzig with the following command to create an account.

## Setting your realm list
```
set realmlist logon.wobgob.org
```

You'll want to set the realm list for your client in `Data/enUS/realmlist.wtf`.
